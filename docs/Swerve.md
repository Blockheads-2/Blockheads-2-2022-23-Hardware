# MiniSwerve

## Our Drivetrain: What is swerve?
Generally Swerve refers to a 360° wheel steering system. Our flavor of swerve is called "differential swerve" refering to the way the motors are paired to the wheel. We'll update our sister site on software with more info on how we control this. 

In our Robot, we put two identical swerve wheels next to eachother, and used 4 omni dead wheels to balance the robot. 

## Currently testing, more details and info coming. We are also rapidly iterating on the gear design at the moment too!

This is pulled right from Fusion, so it may be experimental or untested. But it should be the latest. Find releases of just the "swerve module" in its repo, here: https://github.com/TheDragonlizard/MiniSwerve
