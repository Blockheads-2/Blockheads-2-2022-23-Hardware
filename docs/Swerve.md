## Our Drivetrain: What is swerve?
Generally any Swerve system refers to a 360° wheel steering. Our flavor of swerve is often called "differential swerve" refering to how the motors work together to orient, and drive the wheel. We'll update our sister site for software with more info on how we control this. 

## Big Picture: Swerve Robot
To create a comeptitive drive train, we put two identical Miniswerve 'pods' next to each other.Why only 2? Each of our swerve pods require two full size motors, and a classic mecanum drivetrain is 4 motors. Miniswerve is designed to be a cost comparable replacement for Mecanum, so not taking any more motors than absolutely neccesary is important: it lowers cost, complexity, and makes replacement of existing mecanum systems more accessible. 

But if Miniswerve is a Mecanum replacement, why bother with something new?
Miniswerve should be better than a comparable mecanum drivetrain in a few ways: 

- [x] More Traction 
- [x] Equal top speed & torque in all directions
- [x] Absolute control over wheel position
- [x] Higher Agility


## Currently testing, more details and info coming. We are also rapidly iterating on the gear design at the moment too!

## Download the latest CAD
This is pulled right from Fusion, so it may be experimental or untested. But it should be the latest. Find releases of just the "swerve module" in its repo, here: https://github.com/TheDragonlizard/MiniSwerve  

## Drawbacks

Unfortunately there are some downsides, and we aren't here to hide them. So far we've struggled with: 

- [ ] Ground Clearance
- [ ] Maintenance
- [ ] Ease of assembly
- [ ] Ease of manufacturing

Hopefully as a team we iterate we can eliminate or mitigate these issues, and perhaps teams that choose to develop evolutions of MiniSwerve will come up with unique ways to tackel these drawbacks too!
