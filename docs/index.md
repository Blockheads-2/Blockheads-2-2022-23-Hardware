# Welcome To Team 21525's Hardware Repo!

## Licenses
Licenses are located in their appropiate home folders, but here's the gist: 

 - All hardware unless otherwise specified is GPLv3, that means open source, attribution
required, with no warranty. This is a copyleft license, and you must preserve the license. All modifications to the source must be published under the same license. 
- Mkdocs & Material are under MIT licenses (this is mostly identical to a GPLv3 but more code based)

## Goals
BlockheadsÂ² strives to be as transparent as possible in all our actions. All hardware and Software is public so that we can serve as a resource and a role model for fellow FTC teams who may not have our experience or are just starting out.
