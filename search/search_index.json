Since we can't move the drivetrain upwards, we'll need something that can go vertically to get us there. We had a couple requirements:  - The lifter had to be stiff, with little side to side play - The lifter had use less than 4 motors, and less than 4 servos - The lifter had to be repeatable, and have good accuracy - The lifter need to be as fast as possible. </p>"},{"location":"Lifter/#arm-r1-linkages","title":"Arm R1: Linkages","text":"<p>Our original arm used linkages, inspired by those sweet desk lamps (see pictured). But we quickly learned that due to linkage overextension and backlash, it had a \"dead-zone\", an area where the arm was uncontrollable, and simply would flop around. Ultimately, we switched to direct driving the elbow joint rather than using a linkage.  </p> <p> </p> A demo of the motion this kinematic provides"},{"location":"Lifter/#arm-r2-direct-drive","title":"Arm R2: Direct Drive","text":"<p>Our current arm gets its speed from 3 motors. Two high gearing motors at the base, or shoulder of the arm, and 1 faster motor at the elbow. Because the means the forearm, or B stage is changing rotation, we need a servo \"wrist\" or C stage to keep the claw parralell to the ground.  - You might notice that our Elbow (B) joint uses 3d printed gears! We learned from MiniSwerve that plastic Gears made from ABS &amp; Nylon performed excellent under load when designed to take advantage of anisotropic nature of 3d prints (stronger in certain directions, like a wood grain). So far the Elbow gears have held up to the rigor of competition, and we highly recommend using application specific 3d printed gears when you can!</p>"},{"location":"Lifter/#pinchy-r2-dual-side-low-cost-claw","title":"Pinchy R2: Dual Side, Low Cost Claw","text":"<p>Pinchy is our solution to grabbing cones.

Each of our swerve pods require two full size motors, and a classic mecanum drivetrain is 4 motors, so having 2 modules best mimics mecanum.  Miniswerve is designed to be a cost comparable replacement for Mecanum, so not taking any more motors than absolutely neccesary is important: it lowers cost, complexity, and makes replacement of existing mecanum systems more accessible. </p> <p>But if Miniswerve is a Mecanum replacement, why bother with the added complexity? Miniswerve should be better than a comparable mecanum drivetrain in a few ways: </p> <ul> <li> More Traction, no slip start</li> <li> <ul> <li> Finer movement</li> </ul> </li> <li> Equal top speed &amp; torque but in all directions (instead of a bias toward Left, right, forward, backward)</li> <li> Faster turning on center</li> <li> Higher Agility</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Swerve/#drawbacks","title":"Drawbacks","text":"<p>Unfortunately there are some downsides, and we aren't here to hide them.

We've built two pods, gone through 3 major hardware iterations, countless revisions, and tackled the enormous task of programming swerve from scratch. </p> <p> </p> April 13, 2022: Initial concept of gears, and choosing underlying ratios, much of this geometry is preserved in the final drawings. Also includes a 90mm mockup wheel.  <p> </p> April 15, 2022: Initial concept of mounting plates, first introduction of drive shafts and gears. This is where Miniswerve started to take form. On the same day, the definining difference for MiniSwerve was introduced: Thrust bearings.  <p> </p> April 27, 2022: The first iteration of the suspension system is introduced. Here suspension refers to keeping the gears suspended within the module. Unfortunately, this implementation was fraught with issues, and led to routine binding of the modules.  <p> </p> May 3, 2022: The drives are given their structure, 3 55mm aluminum extrusions, bolted through the plates at both ends. These will hold the module in tension, and give it the rigidity it needs to transfer force from the wheels, to the bearings, to the frame. After this point, the concept is set aside for a bit, as its future team was yet to be fully formed.   <p> </p> June 6, 2022: The drive system's primary gearing is manufactured for the first time. While these gears would never see competition use, they were key in establishing the viability of the concept.  <p> </p> June 28, 2022: Team 21525 starts meeting for the first times, sporadically, as we prepare for the season. Just days earlier, we chose to adopt the experimental swerve drive as our 22-23 drivetrain. In this iteration, changes are mostly focused on preparing the main CNC machined plates for manufacture.   <p> </p> August 3, 2022: In this snapshot, the primary focus was designing the wheel, instead of leaving as a simple 92mm placeholder. We chose to use a 6 spoke PET wheel with a TPU tire."},{"location":"Swerve/#today","title":"Today","text":"<p>MiniSwerve got its start early, and its taken a while to bring it to this point.
